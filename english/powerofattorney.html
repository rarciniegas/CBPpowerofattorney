        <h2 class="mt-4" onclick="toggleContent('einContent')" role="button">1. EIN</h2>
        <div id="einContent" class="content">
            <p>An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to businesses in the United States. It is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number and is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. The EIN is required for tasks like filing business tax returns, opening a business bank account, and hiring employees. It’s essentially like a Social Security Number for businesses.</p>

        <div id="companyTypeContent" class="content">
            <p>According to the IRS, there are several types of corporations in the United States. The most common ones are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C Corporation (C Corp)</strong><br>
                    <em>Description:</em> The standard type of corporation. It is a separate legal entity from its owners, meaning it can be taxed and held legally liable independently.<br>
                    <em>Taxation:</em> Subject to "double taxation" – the corporation pays taxes on profits, and shareholders also pay taxes on dividends.<br>
                    <em>Best for:</em> Larger companies with multiple shareholders or those seeking investment from venture capital or going public.
                </li>
                <li><strong>S Corporation (S Corp)</strong><br>
                    <em>Description:</em> A corporation that elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to shareholders for federal tax purposes.<br>
                    <em>Taxation:</em> Avoids double taxation by allowing income to "pass-through" to shareholders who report it on their individual tax returns.<br>
                    <em>Requirements:</em>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limited to 100 shareholders.</li>
                        <li>Shareholders must be U.S. citizens or residents.</li>
                        <li>Only one class of stock allowed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <em>Best for:</em> Small businesses that want the legal protection of a corporation but with the tax advantages of a partnership.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</strong><br>
                    <em>Description:</em> Though not technically a corporation, an LLC is a flexible legal structure that offers the limited liability of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership.<br>
                    <em>Taxation:</em> LLCs can choose to be taxed as a sole proprietorship, partnership, C corporation, or S corporation depending on their needs.<br>
                    <em>Best for:</em> Small businesses seeking flexibility in management and taxation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nonprofit Corporation</strong><br>
                    <em>Description:</em> Formed to pursue charitable, educational, religious, or other public-oriented goals, and must adhere to specific requirements to maintain tax-exempt status under IRS Section 501(c)(3).<br>
                    <em>Taxation:</em> Tax-exempt, meaning they do not pay federal income tax on their income, provided it’s related to their mission.<br>
                    <em>Best for:</em> Organizations focused on charitable, religious, or educational missions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Personal Service Corporation (PSC)</strong><br>
                    <em>Description:</em> A corporation that performs services in specific fields like law, accounting, consulting, and health services.<br>
                    <em>Taxation:</em> Subject to a flat 21% corporate tax rate. Owners who provide services must report income as compensation.<br>
                    <em>Best for:</em> Corporations where most of the activity is performed by the owners themselves, typically in professional services industries.
                </li>
            </ul>
            These structures provide different tax, legal, and financial benefits depending on the needs of the business.

        In a corporation, the power of attorney (POA) can typically be signed by someone with the legal authority to bind the corporation, which usually includes:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Officers</strong><br>
                CEO, President, CFO, or Vice President: These high-ranking corporate officers often have the authority to execute important documents, including a POA, on behalf of the corporation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Directors</strong><br>
                Board of Directors: In some cases, a POA may need to be authorized or approved by the board of directors, particularly if the powers granted are significant or outside the usual scope of management.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Authorized Employees or Agents</strong><br>
                Corporate Secretary or Other Designated Officers: The board or corporate bylaws may designate certain individuals, such as a corporate secretary or other officers, to sign a POA on the corporation’s behalf.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Attorneys-in-Fact</strong><br>
                A corporation can authorize an individual to act as an attorney-in-fact, granting them the power to act on behalf of the corporation through a POA. This person does not need to be an officer but must be formally designated.
            </li>
